## Introduction
The purpose of an ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) System is to take an image of a car and use image processing techniques to separate
the license plate from the car itself, and process each character individually with an algorithm. The system is then capable of ensuring whether a car is allowed entry or not based on their license plate. The idea behind our project is to design and implement a small embedded ANPR prototype system, using a OV7675 Camera as sensor and
a servo as actuator. The "Smart" part of our project is to introduce IoT into the system and use a webservice in the cloud (QuestDB in this case) to access information.
